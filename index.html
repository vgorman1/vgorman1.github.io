<h3> I have made a series of videos explaining how to make dependency trees in Arethusa/Perseids for someone who already knows Greek.  
    You can find them on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuG1kAJT77ib5KESRHz-BCQ">YouTubeChannel.</a></h3> 
  <h3> I have made a series of videos ("Grammar 101-104") explaining basic English grammar needed to read Ancient Greek, using dependency syntax terms.  They are intended for someone who knows no Greek.  
    You can find all these videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuG1kAJT77ib5KESRHz-BCQ">YouTubeChannel.</a></h3>
